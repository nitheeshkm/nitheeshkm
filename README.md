### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on various FPGA designs at Broadcast Sports International.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to create my own RSIC V with deep neural network acceleration and learn custom linux driver drivers.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on challenging FPGA projects including open source CPUs, accelerate AI DNNs and re-innovate broadcasting. 
- 💬 Ask me about Video encoders, decoders, Transport stream, video and audio codecs, DNN accelerators.
- 💼 I've experince in RTL design, ASIC synthesis and layout design, and taped out an AI accelerator for which I did the RTL and ASIC synthesis.
